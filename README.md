# DOPPLE BOT: A Social Deduction Game
### Created By: Dan Schumacher Haven Kotara & Kosi 

## Overview
Dopple Bot is a research project for Dr. Fred Martin's Ai4K12 course. 
This game tasks human players with determining who among them is secretly an Ai bot - with a twist!
Unbeknownst to players (initially), these bots are dopplegangers! Not only will human players have to figure out which players are bots, they will have to convince their team that they are the real 'them'. 

Inspired by popular social deception games like Wherewolf and AmongUs, Dopple Bot aims to educate players on the importance of data security and provide an interractive example on how Ai could use their personal information maliciously.
